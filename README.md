# Scala-Learning

The repository contains the learning journey/getting familiar with Scala and Functional Programming drills. Assignments have been implemented, introducing to most of the utilities in Scala and concepts of functional programming. 

## Topics Covered:

* Scala Collections (Mutable and Immutable - List, Arrays, Sequence, List Buffer, Array Buffer, Vectors, Maps, Iterators, etc) 
* Higher Order Functions
* Wildcard and its uses.
* Scala built-in utility functions - map(), zip(), fill(), tabulate() etc
* Tail Recursion
* Singleton Objects
* Pure Functions and what makes a function impure.

P.S: All the support documents, assignment files and PDF of Scala and Functional Programming can be accessed in [Doc](https://github.com/Agha-Muqarib/Scala-Learning/tree/main/Docs) Folder of the repository.
